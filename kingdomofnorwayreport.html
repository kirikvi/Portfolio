        <h2>The Semester Project Exam</h2>
        <p>This is my latest project, and I am happy about the design and about the coding. 
            I prioritized to update the other two projects, and therefore ended up with little time left to update this project
            and unfortunatly did not have time to ask for help with the carousel.</p>
        <p>I made the following updates:</p>
        
        <h2>Making a clone</h2>
        <p>I was terrified to make changes to the actual project exam, so I copied the files manually 
            and created a new folder and made a new repository from scratch to make sure I did not do anything wrong by just cloning the repository with 
            GitHub.</p>
        
        <h2>Carousel</h2>
        <p>I don't know how to fix the "zoom" problem when clicking the next/previous button.</p>
        <img src="images/2021-05-23 (1).png" alt="a screen dump of the kingdom of norway blog">
        <p>This annoys me, because other than that I am happy about the design.
            If I could have gone back in time, I would have asked for help on the first day, so I could have been 100% pleased with
            this project. I would also have asked how to make the carousel go in a loop.</p>

        <h2>CSS updates</h2>
        <p>I came across a minor tweak with the archive item images on smaller screens. I had styled the image in the media query with max-width instead of width, 
            which made the image narrower than what I wanted it to be.</p>
        <p>Before</p>

        <p>After</p>

        <h2>Search function</h2>
        </p>I followed MJ's <a href="https://scrimba.com/scrim/cdqdnQUr">filter() method tutorial</a>, but wanted to find a way to make the user search for only part of the title, like "troll" and 
        not the full title "Trolltunga". This lead me to use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_includes.asp">includes() method</a>.</p>

        <h2>Removed console.log from script files</h3>
        <p>It is no use for the console.logs now that the site is finished, so I removed them to make it easier to read the files.</p>
