        <h2>The Semester Project</h2>
        <p>Updating this site was really time consuming, and there still is a lot I could change. I am not satisfied with this website, and if I could, I would start from scratch. 
        I thought it was too dark, and I did not feel that the user flow were as smooth as it should have been.
        Because of the limited amount of time, I focused on making the site better from the feedback I got, and making the site more dynamic with JavaScript and less
        HTML files.</p>
        <p>I made the following updates:</p>

        <h2>WordPress</h2>
        <p>I created a WordPress site, and downloaded the WooCommerce plugin to hold the events and exhibitions content. Then I did an API call to fetch the content from there. 
        I could now delete the different event and exhibition files, and only have one to hold the content built with JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I also added Lorem Ipsum text to add some more text to the pages.</p>

        <h2>Feedback from tutors</h2>
        <p>The feedback I got was:</p>

        <p class="quote">"The home page header text (Explore Together) gets a bit lost behind the light parts of the image background and might be challenging to read for some users."</p>
        <p>I redid the design and changed the header image, so this is not a problem anymore.</p> 

        <p class="quote">"There seems to be some layout/alignment issues on the Explore page which needs some tweaking."</p>
        <p>I removed the divs and flex styling on the page, because there really was not a reason to keep them. This is not a problem anymore.</p>

        <p class="quote">"Can hover on Exhibitions and Events section but miss the link. Best to wrap the item that’s going to be hovered on with the link"</p>
        <p>I wrapped the items in anchor tags (built with JavaScript), so the whole item is clickable now.</p>
        
        <p class="quote">"Would be good if you used classes to avoid repetition. .exhibition-item img, .special-item img, .left img Could just be one class. Would prefer you didn’t use IDs for styling, for example the below should just be one class. #cos-header, #evo-header, #rob-header, 
            #eco-header, #bio-header, #night-header, #energetica-header, #fut-header { height: 550px; background-attachment: fixed; } IDs are useful for on page interactivity, 
            while classes are best for styling. Worth noting that you can add multiple classes to the same element.
            Would prefer a clearer class naming strategy than ‘left’ and ‘right’."</p> 
        <p>I have made a lot of changes to the classnames and css to avoid repetition and unclear classnames. The files look much better now.</p>
            
        <p class="quote">"Nav has a div with class of nav inside it. We try use as few divs as possible, so perhaps styling the nav itself would have been best."</p>
        <p>I went crazy with the divs on this project, and I have spent hours deleting them, hehe. I do not know why I ended up with so many divs, and many of them did not even have a 
            function. I have learnt a lot from this, and know what to avoid in future projects.</p>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>I started by deleting all the individual event and exhibition files, and created one new file.</p>
        <p>After that I looked over all the files left, and removed every unnessesary class/id and element, for example divs, like the div in the footer on the image below.
            The HTML files were a complete mess, and did not have a clear hierarchy with parent-child-grandchild relationships.
            It was so satisfying to look at the files when I was done cleaning. It looks much better now.</p>
            
        <p>I moved the content from the "visit"-page to the "index-page" to make the information about the museum more accessible to the users.
        After that I deleted the "visit"-link and icon from the navigation menu, wich made the navigation more clear.</p>

        <p>I changed the navigation code from a clot of anchor tags inside a div inside the nav, to an unordered list. It is easier now to read and understand the code.</p>

        <h2>The Design & CSS</h2>
        <p>While deleting the unnessesary HTML-elements and classes, I deleted and adjusted the CSS-file to make sure I did not style elements that did not exist anymore.</p>
        <p>I did some big changes with the design on the site. It went from this dark site with different styles from page to page, to a 
            lighter site with the same general styling. I removed all "background-color" on the different pages, added a "linear-gradient"
            style on the body, to give all the pages the same background-color.</p>

        <p>I liked the look with the dark theme on the "before"-pages, but with the consistency in mind, 
            I think it looks better now. I made it more "fun" and "child-friendly" with round edges on the navigation, images and forms.</p>

        <p>I also changed the index page header image to an image from the inside of a museum. I believe it will be easier for the users to
            understand that they are on the correct website.</p>

        <img src="images/index-after.png" alt="a screen dump from the community scirence museum website" class="mobile"> 
        <img src="images/exhibit-before.png" alt="a screen dump from the community scirence museum website" class="mobile">   
        <img src="images/exhibit-after.png" alt="a screen dump from the community scirence museum website" class="mobile">          
        
        <p>I wanted to add something more to the index page, so I added three boxes to make the content of the site even more accessible.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>I fetched the exhibition and event content with WP REST API and async function. I used an if statement to return the elements with the correct category (set in WP).
        This way the user only sees the exhibitions on the exhibitions page, and the events on the event page.</p>
        <img src="images/2021-06-05 (5).png" alt="a screen dump from visual studio code">

        <p>I added a loader to indicate to the user that he/she should wait for the content to load.</p>
        <img src="images/2021-06-05 (6).png" alt="a screen dump from the community scirence museum website">

        <p>I made a contact form with form validation, to make the site more user friendy.</p>

        </p>The last day before the deadline I wanted to try to make the search be functional, but struggled to make it work. I watched MJ's <a href="https://scrimba.com/scrim/cdqdnQUr">filter() method tutorial</a>, 
        but I could not get it to work. I have learnt this year that I always put myself in the situation that I try new things in the weekends
        when the tutors are not available. Shame on me. I will leave the code (even if it does not work) to hopefully get some feedback on where I did wrong.</p>
