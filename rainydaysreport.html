        <h2>Cross-course project</h2>
        <p>My first ever page. After already making a few updates earlier in this programme, I am not sure what more I can do 
        to this site in a matter of Design, but I looked back at the feedback, and changed a few things.
        I made the following updates:</p> 
        
        <h2>Adjustments after feedback from tutors</h2>
        <p class="quote">"It's a relatively small thing, but I'd recommend keeping folder names lowercase. So instead of 'Images', just 'images'." - MJ</p> 
        <p>I changed this.</p>
        
        <p class="quote">"The only UI change I would recommend is to change up one of the decorative heading fonts for a simpler one that is easy to read; as they both are currently quite busy. Maybe swopping out the serif type for a cleaner Sans serif (a bold weight of the body typography would work!)" - Suzani Reitz</p>
        <p>I changed the serif font to the body font as suggested, and here is the before and after. I think I prefer the serif font, but i would like to keep the handwritten style on the next line, so I kept the change to not have two "busy" fonts next to eachother.</p>

        <h2>DRY principle</h2>
        <p>While changing the font, I could not believe how messy my code were. I have not been following the DRY principle, so I did a "clean up" to make the code more well written and made sure I did not repeat myself.</p>
        <p>After the changes there is (hopefully) no more repeated styling.</p>
        <p>I remember thinking I did alright following the DRY principle, but when I think back I undestand how
            I ended up with such a messy CSS-file. The problem is that I added new elements and styled them one by one, instead of looking at the "whole picture", making
            sure there was no repeated codes. I have learnt a lot from updating my previuos projects, 
            and know what to avoid in the future.</p>

        <h2>Removed console.log from script files</h2>
        <p>There is no use for the console.logs now that the site is finished, so I removed them to make it easier to read the files.</p>

        <h2>The Design</h2>
        <p>I did not change anything about the design, other than the font I got feedback about. I am happy with the design of the site, I can see
            from the hotjar data that the user flow is smooth, and have also got a lot of positive feedback from friends, family and tutors.</p>
